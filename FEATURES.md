# Features Guide

## Core Features

### üîê Authentication
- **Email/Password**: Secure login with hashed passwords
- **Google OAuth**: One-click sign-in with Google account
- **Session Management**: Persistent sessions (24 hours default, 30 days with "Remember Me")

### üìÖ Smart Scheduling
- **Natural Language**: Type commands like "Schedule meeting tomorrow at 2pm"
- **Conflict Detection**: Automatic detection of scheduling conflicts
- **AI Resolution**: Get smart suggestions for resolving conflicts
- **Timezone Intelligence**: Proper timezone handling for accurate scheduling

### ü§ñ Intelligent Task Planning
- **Proactive Study Planning**: Give a task with deadline, AI schedules multiple study sessions
- **Task Splitting**: Automatically splits long tasks into smaller time blocks
- **Free Time Analysis**: AI analyzes your calendar to find optimal study times

### üìö Duration Learning System

The AI learns from your feedback about how long assignments take for your specific classes.

#### How to Use

1. **Click "üìö Teach Duration Patterns"** in Quick Actions
2. **Type natural feedback** like:
   - "ECEN 380 homework takes 4-5 hours"
   - "CS 220 projects need 6 hours"
   - "Lab reports typically take 2 hours"
3. **Watch the AI learn** with visual feedback:
   - üü† Orange pulsing border = Processing
   - üü¢ Green flash = Success
   - Displays extracted info (class, type, duration)

#### Examples

**Class-Specific:**
```
"ECEN 380 homework takes 4-5 hours"
"CS 101 projects require 8 hours"
"MATH 290 problem sets need 3 hours"
```

**General Patterns:**
```
"Lab reports typically take 2 hours"
"Reading assignments usually need 1.5 hours"
"Exam studying requires 4 hours"
```

#### How It Works

When you schedule:
```
"Schedule time for ECEN 380 homework 3, due Friday"
```

The AI will:
1. Check learned patterns for "ECEN 380 homework"
2. Apply your feedback (4.5 hours instead of default 2 hours)
3. Schedule accordingly, splitting into multiple sessions if needed

#### Priority System

1. **Class-specific patterns** (highest) - "ECEN 380 homework takes 5 hours"
2. **General patterns** (medium) - "homework takes 3 hours"
3. **Default patterns** (lowest) - Built-in defaults

### ‚úÖ Daily Task Management
- **Automatic Task Checklist**: Fetches today's events from Google Calendar
- **Interactive Calendar View**: Full calendar widget with all events
- **Quick Actions**: Fast access to common tasks

### ‚ö° Performance Features
- **30-Day Event Caching**: Improved responsiveness, reduced API calls
- **Smart Background Updates**: Calendar stays in sync automatically

## Visual Feedback States

The feedback system has 4 distinct visual states:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ IDLE (Blue)
- Normal state, ready for input

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ PROCESSING (Orange Pulsing)
- Shows "üß† Processing your feedback..."
- Animated border glow
- Spinning loader on button

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ SUCCESS (Green Flash)
- ‚úì Checkmark animation
- Shows extracted information:
  - üìö Class name
  - üìù Assignment type
  - ‚è±Ô∏è Duration
- Auto-clears input after 2 seconds

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ ERROR (Red Shake)
- ‚úó Error icon
- Border shake animation
- Clear error message

## Advanced Usage

### Viewing Learned Patterns

Click **"View Learned Patterns"** to see all duration feedback:
```
üìö Learned Duration Patterns

Class-Specific Patterns:
‚Ä¢ ECEN 380 homework: 4.5 hours
‚Ä¢ CS 220 projects: 7 hours

General Patterns:
‚Ä¢ Lab reports: 2 hours
```

### Refining Over Time

As you learn more about your workload, update patterns:
```
Initial: "ECEN 380 homework takes 4 hours"
Later: "ECEN 380 homework now takes 5-6 hours"
```

The AI will use the most recent feedback.

### Task Splitting Example

If you need 6 hours for a project but only have 2-hour blocks:
```
You: "Work on CS 220 project, due in 2 weeks"
AI: Schedules 3 sessions of 2 hours each across multiple days
```

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Be specific with class names** - Use exact format (e.g., "ECEN 380" not "ecen380")
2. **Use ranges for variety** - "4-5 hours" averages to 4.5 hours
3. **Update as you learn** - Submit new feedback when estimates change
4. **Include assignment types** - "homework", "project", "lab", "exam"
5. **Review patterns regularly** - Check what the AI has learned

---

## Storage & Persistence

- **User data**: `users.json` - Account information
- **Sessions**: `sessions.json` - Active sessions
- **Feedback**: `duration_feedback.json` - Learned patterns
- **All files persist** across Docker restarts (volume mounted)
